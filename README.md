===================

This repository contains a few useful tools for handling Klingon pIqaD text.

Klingon Universal Transliterator
--------------------------------

The Universal Transliterator is a standalone HTML+JavaScript document that
automatically converts between Latinized (both Okrandian and xifan hol) Klingon
text and pIqaD encoded with the encoding registered in the Conscript Unicode
Registry in the Private Use Area of the Basic Multilingual Plane from U+F8D0
to U+F8FF.
